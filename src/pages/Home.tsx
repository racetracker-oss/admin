Are you really the wise one you claim to be, or is the dragon's breath playing tricks on me? Show your magic spells, or wait for the next unsuspecting traveler!",

    "Well, well, who do we have here? Another valiant soul wishing to enter the Forbidden Forest. There's only one way to pass â€” show that you are indeed who you claim to be and present your precious relics. Don't worry, the fauns don't bite... much.",
    "Look who's here, another adventurer seeking the secrets of the Enchanted Fortress. But remember, only those can enter who prove themselves. Do you have the entry permission and the right to stay? If not, you might just be another adventure novel here, at the gate!"
